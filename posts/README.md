# Sypher
## A simple runtime static blog

Sypher is a easy-to-use lightweight static blog that uses Markdown files to write posts.

### You don't need to install any script or programming language stack to run it.

Just create your post file, add it to post list and don't be worried about using something like NodeJS or Ruby to compile your files. Sypher don't need them, cause it runs only in the front-end.

### Responsive Design

You want your posts to be read in a smartphone, tablet or desktop? No problem, Sypher can renderize in all them.

### It's open-source

Need something different? You can fork this project and modify when you want. You won't pay for that(just if you do want).
